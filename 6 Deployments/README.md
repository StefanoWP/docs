## DEPLOYMENTS
---

Once you have [setup your project's local git repo][setup-repo] and [lined up the hooks][hooks], you are ready to [deploy your app][deploy]. All you need to do is click the `ðŸš€ Deploy Now` button!

Cleaver supports zero downtime deployments right out of the box. This means once deployment is made, it takes fractions of seconds to switch from the old version of your site to the latest version of your site - so quick that it really is almost zero downtime.

Cleaver saves the last 5 deployments so that you could rollback to an old one quickly if you need to.

If your app depends on .env file (like a Laravel app does), make sure to [add and activate][env] your .env variables.

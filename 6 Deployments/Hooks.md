## HOOKS
---

Hooks are a collection of scripts that are run in order when deploying an app. Think of them as steps necessary to deploy an app successfully.

If you select `Hooks` tab after setting up a repository, you will notice that Cleaver installs some hooks for you. These hooks are needed to deploy your app properly. You cannot delete these hooks. 

You will also notice that some of the hooks have a ðŸ”’ icon in front of them. These hooks cannot be deleted or disabled. Hooks without a ðŸ”’ can be disabled.

> **ðŸ—’ Note**: Enabling or disabling a hook won't affect a deployment that's already in progress. If you make any changes to hooks, you have to deploy your app again for the changes to take effect.

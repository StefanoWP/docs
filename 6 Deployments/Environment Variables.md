## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---
> **ðŸ—’ Note**: Only applies to Laravel apps

As you should already know, Laravel allows you configuration variables via an .env file. You can add these variables in Cleaver and then copy to server whenever you need to. Let's see how:

1. Select a Laravel site.

2. Select `Deployments` from the sidebar and then select `Environment` tab.

3. **.ENV FILE PATH**: Browse your `.env` file that you'd like to copy to your server. We recommend that you have a `.env.cleaver` file for your live site.

4. Once you are ready, click **Add** button.

## MANAGING DATABASE SERVER
---

Cleaver lets you install, configure, and manage databases and database users using its intuitive UI. Right now Cleaver supports MySQL database server version 5.7 and MariaDB database server version 10.2.

You can decide to install a database server when provisioning the server or later, when creating a database or a database user. Whenever you decide to install a database server, a root database user will be created and a random password will be set for you. You can find the root database user password in your keychain.

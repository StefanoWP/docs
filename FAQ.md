## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Where is all the my servers and sites information/ metadata
    saved?**

Cleaver doesn't save any of your information in the cloud. This
    means you own the information about your servers and sites and
    nobody else. They are saved on your local machine in a single file -
   `cleaver.db`. The location depends on the type of Operating
    System you are using:
    
 On OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/cleaver/`
    
 On Windows:  `%APPDATA%/cleaver`
       
 On Linux:   `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cleaver` or `~/.config/cleaver`

One thing we know for sure is that we want to make Cleaver accessible and affordable to everyone, despite their revenue and geographic location. For now the only thing we want from you is to let other people know about Cleaver!

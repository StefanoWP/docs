## ADDING A STATIC SITE
---

### STEPS

1. Select the server you want to add this static site to.

2. Select `Sites` menu from the secondary sidebar.

3. Click the **Add New Site** button.

4. **DOMAIN NAME**: Domain name for this site like example.com. You must provide this value.

5. **ALSO ADD DNS RECORDS**: If you check this checkbox, Cleaver will add an [A record][dns] for your domain as well as a [www CNAME][dns]* for your domain. This basically means that if you added a site, say example.com, Cleaver configures your domain records with your cloud provider so that eventually you will be able to access your website using both example.com and www.example.com. This will only work if you have pointed your domain to the nameservers of the selected cloud providers (such as ns1.digitalocean.com, ns1.vultr.com etc)

5. **PROJECT TYPE**: **Static HTML** should be selected by default. If not, select it.

6. **WEB DIRECTORY**: The directory is where the site will point to while serving files. In other words, directory where the "point-of-entry" (usually index.html) for this site will be. For example, if your `index.html` file will be in the top folder of the site, leave this field blank. But instead if the index file will be, say, in `public` sub-directory of the site folder, you want to put `public` for the value.

7. **SECURE WITH LET'S ENCRYPT**: Check this field if you want to install and configure SSL certificates (from Let's Encrypt) for this site. We highly recommend you to check this option; after all it's free! If you decide to check this field and install SSL certificates, you must provide a valid email address.
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: If you have not checked the checkbox in step 5 to let Cleaver configure DNS records for you, make sure you domain is pointed to the nameservers of the selected cloud provider otherwise this setup will fail.
> **üóí Note**: In case you decided not to secure your site with free SSL certificates at this time, you can always [install SSL certificates and secure your site later](/ssl-certificates.md).

8. Double check that all the values are what you wanted and then click **Add** button.

Cleaver will finish installing and configuring the site for you within a couple of minutes.

> **üóí Note**: If this is the first secure site on the server then it is going to take few extra minutes to make sure your SSL certificates are as secure as possible.

Once it is done, you can click on a little arrow to visit the site on your browser. Make sure that it's served over https and not http.

> üçÑ Just for fun, after Cleaver is done adding your site, you could go to https://ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html to check what security grade your site gets. It should get at least an A because you deserve nothing less!

If things are still not clear, or if you are having an issue, please send us an email. In the meantime, watch the following clip that shows how to create a secure static web app using Cleaver: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R6K-aOu3A7o?rel=0

\* www CNAME is only added for a domain and not for a sub-domain

## GETTING STARTED
---

### PREREQUISITES:
The only "soft" prerequisite for Cleaver on all supported platforms is that you need to have git installed and should be in your path. Cleaver only requires git for deployments. Given that Cleaver is a tool for developer, we expect everyone to have git already installed.


## macOS

### STEPS

1. [Download Cleaver for macOS][1].
2. To avoid any issue with the file permissions and to avoid any kind of possible data loss, copy Cleaver app to your */Applications* folder first.
3. Open the app and sign in. If you have not signed up yet, it only takes few seconds to create a new account.
